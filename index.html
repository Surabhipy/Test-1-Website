    <p>
        If you're new to web fonts, you might be wondering: what are web fonts? Don't worry. Here we'll cover what web
        fonts are and how to install web fonts. We'll also show you some of the best web fonts from Envato Elements.

        Web fonts are fonts especially created for websites. They're usually on a web server. This means web fonts are
        downloaded by the browser while rendering the web page, and then applied to the text.

    <p>
        Web fonts need to include four types of files: a TrueType file, a WOFF file, an EOT file, and an SVG file.
        Each of these files is designed for different browsers. You'll need all four when using web fonts to build a
        website. This ensures your font will display on all browsers.
